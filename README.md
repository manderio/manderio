### Hi there, I'm mander

Friendly neighborhood tech support and residental linux nerd who is dabbling in programming.
Currently working as a sysadmin/devops junior in a windows enviroment 
(that is fluff for i do tech support with occasional scripting and deployments in CM)

Currently I am working on:
- remander - a tool to help my adhd by managing to-do lists
- mandolin - a discord bot I am writing in kotlin to learn discord API and Kotlin
- mander.io - my network setup and structure

Upcoming projects:
- manderbot - a bot for discord that will be using remander, although this is a later project

_Note, all my projects are private repos at the moment since they are being started, however, 
if you would like to know more, feel free to just ask me about it. I am always happy to
discuss what I am working on at the moment_

Languages I ~~know~~ am learning atm:
- Python (but rarely use it)
- Haskell (on pause at this time)
- Powershell (for windows administration)
- Starting with Kotlin soon enough
- Will pick up Rust at some point when I am less of a dumbdumb

My interests include:
- breaking software
- fixing software
- mainly the first one
- linux related things

Please do not come for me, but if you do, I will be extremely supportive and try to help you as much as possible.

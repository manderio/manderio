### Hi there, I'm mander

Friendly neighborhood tech support and residental linux nerd who is dabbling in programming.
Currently working as a sysadmin/devops junior in a windows enviroment 
(that is fluff for i do tech support with occasional scripting and deployments in CM)

Currently I am working on:
- remander - a tool to help my adhd by managing to-do lists
- manderbot - a bot for discord that will be using remander, although this is a later project

Languages I ~~know~~ am learning atm:
- Python
- Haskell
- Powershell (regrettably)
- Will pick up rust at some point when I am less of a dumbdumb

My interests include:
- breaking software
- fixing software
- linux related things

Please do not come for me, I am shit at everything I am doing and very new to this.

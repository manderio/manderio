## Hi there, I'm mander
Friendly neighborhood tech support and residental linux nerd as well as hug provider dabbling in programming!

#### Quickly about me
Have been a sysadmin for a few years now. Fell in love with linux due to a boring summer day, now I am stuck here. 
I will never allow myself to be seen as more than an enthusiast with an addiction to solving problems. Most of the projects
I work on are dead due to a full work life, but goal is to post more C soon... Though not very good code because I am a 
self taught newbie.
